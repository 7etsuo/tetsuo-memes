## Purpose
The goal is to maintain a curated library of quality memes that reflect the TETSUO community and brand. By centralizing these assets, users and contributors can easily find and share approved memes in various channels.

## Directory Structure
- **`memes/images/`**: All image-based memes (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) should be placed here.
- **`memes/video/`**: All video-based memes (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mov`) should be placed here.

Ensure your submissions are organized into the correct directory before making a pull request.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork this repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository for your meme submissions.
3. Add your memes to the appropriate directory:
   - Image-based memes go in `memes/images/`
   - Video-based memes go in `memes/video/`
4. Commit your changes and push them to your branch.
5. Open a pull request to this repositoryâ€™s `main` branch with a brief description of the meme and its relevance.

## Guidelines
- Ensure that all submissions are relevant and support the TETSUO brand.
- Memes should be of reasonable quality and free of inappropriate content.
- File names should be descriptive and should not include offensive language.

## Review Process
All pull requests will be reviewed to ensure relevance, quality, and compliance with guidelines. Once approved, your memes will be merged into the repository and made available for use by the community.
